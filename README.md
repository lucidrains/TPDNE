# TPDNE (wip)

Thispersondoesnotexist went down, so this time, while building it back up, I am going to open source all of it. I'll try to make it modular enough so anyone can deploy their own ever-dreaming GAN (or soon to be 1-2 step DDPM) to be public facing

I may also take some time to do something I've always wanted. To Dreambooth my dog into the machine and have it dream her up forever to the public.
